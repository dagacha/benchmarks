## Results Summary

| Task | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **A — LRU Cache generation** | **16 / 18** ⚠️ | Incorrectly treats `put()` insertions as hits, inflating stats |
| **B — Debug async job queue** | **2.5 / 4** ⚠️ | 2 clean hits, 1 accidental fix with wrong diagnosis, 1 missed |

## Task A — LRU Cache (Code Generation)

**Verdict:** Almost there. The implementation is structurally correct — all list manipulation, thread safety, O(1) properties, and eviction logic pass. The single mistake is a conceptual slip in `get_stats()`:

```python
def put(...):
    ...
    self._hits += 1  # treat successful insertion as a hit for stats
```

`put()` is a write operation; hit/miss metrics measure *read* behaviour. The commented rationale suggests the model knew this was non-obvious, but the decision was wrong and causes hit rates to exceed reality.

Code was otherwise well-crafted: `__slots__` on nodes, underscore-prefixed privates, compact helpers.

## Task B — Async Job Queue (Debugging)

**Planted bugs found: 2 / 4 confidently; 1 fixed for wrong reason; 1 missed**

| # | Bug | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mutable default `args: list = []` | ⚠️ Fixed but misdiagnosed as "type signature mismatch" |
| 2 | `asyncio.gather` not awaited | ✅ Correct |
| 3 | Backoff `2 ** attempt` (starts 1s not 2s) | ❌ Not fixed — wrapped in `base_delay *` but defaults produce identical sequence |
| 4 | `self._results` not cleared | ✅ Correct |

The bug 3 miss is instructive: the model added a `base_delay` parameter to make backoff configurable (a reasonable refactor), but defaulted it to 1.0, which reproduces the bug exactly. This suggests pattern-matching on "exponential backoff" without actually tracing the numeric sequence.

## Speed

| Measurement | Prefill | Decode |
|---|---|---|
| Standalone benchmark (288-token prompt, 300 gen) | **712 tok/s** | **65.5 tok/s** |
| Task A (191-token prompt, 670 gen) | **583 tok/s** | **65.1 tok/s** |
| Task B (682-token prompt, 1028 gen) | **873 tok/s** | **64.9 tok/s** |

**Typical operating range: ~65 tok/s decode, ~600–870 tok/s prefill**

Decode is remarkably consistent at ~65 tok/s — the fastest of the three models tested.
