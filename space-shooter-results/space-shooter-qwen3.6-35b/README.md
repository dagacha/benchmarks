# Octopus Invaders

A fast-paced, vertical space shooter built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. No libraries, no frameworks — just 1,470 lines of code across 11 files.

## AI-Generated

This game was generated **in a single shot** by **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** (a 35B-parameter MoE model running locally via llama.cpp on a Radeon 8060S GPU).

- **Prompt:** [octopus_invaders_prompt.md](https://github.com/sudoingX/octopus-invaders/blob/main/prompts/octopus_invaders_prompt.md) (~9,000 chars)
- **Generation time:** 5.3 minutes (16,083 tokens at ~50 tok/s)
- **Manual fixes needed:** 2 init-order bugs (see below)
- **Model settings:** temp=0.3, reasoning-budget=1024, ctx=32768

### Fixes Applied After Generation

1. **`index.html`** — The model used ES module `import/export` in all JS files but loaded them with plain `<script>` tags. Changed to `<script type="module" src="js/game.js">` so the module import chain works.
2. **`js/game.js`** — The constructor created `Background`, `UI`, and `Player` objects using `canvas` before `init()` assigned it. Moved those instantiations into `init()` after canvas setup.

Both are initialization-order bugs, not logic errors. All game mechanics, rendering, audio, and particle systems are the model's original output.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal in this folder
2. Start a local server:
   ```
   python -m http.server 3001
   ```
3. Open **http://localhost:3001** in your browser
4. Click to start playing

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **Mouse** | Move ship (smooth lerp tracking) |
| **Left click (hold)** | Fire weapons |
| **ESC** | Pause / Resume |
| **Click** | Start game / Restart after game over |
